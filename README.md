# Embedded System-Controlled Car Using ATmega16 Microcontroller
## Project Overview:
This project involves designing and building a basic car model controlled using an ATmega16 microcontroller and a motor driver. The car performs essential movements such as moving forward, moving backward, turning right, and turning left. The car is controlled through physical buttons, each corresponding to specific actions.

## Movement Control:
Move forward
Move backward
Turn right (with a purple LED indicating the right turn)
Turn left (with a blue LED indicating the left turn)
A dedicated stop button is also included to halt the car at any point.

## Components:

ATmega16 Microcontroller: The central processing unit of the system, responsible for receiving input from the control buttons and sending commands to the motor driver.
Motor Driver: Controls the movement of the car based on the instructions from the ATmega16, enabling the car to move forward, backward, and turn.
LED Indicators:
A purple LED turns on when the car makes a right turn.
A blue LED turns on when the car makes a left turn.
Control Buttons: Provide manual control over the car's movement, with buttons for forward, backward, turning left, turning right, and stopping.
## Key Features:

Manual button-based control of the car's movement
Visual indication (LEDs) for turning directions
Basic car functionalities implemented with minimal hardware
This project demonstrates the integration of microcontroller programming, motor control, and embedded system design to achieve a functional car model.
